# Computational Dynamics for Robotics

This MATLAB code framework accompanies the lecture **Computational Dynamics for Robotics** held at the University of Stuttgart.

The code will be updated as we go along the semester. Currently, the following lectures are ready for general consumption. Feel free to look at other parts of the code, though not everything is guaranteed to work yet.

## Contributing

Feel free to raise issues. If you would like to make a code contribution, feel free to fork the repository and make a pull request. Otherwise, you can directly clone this repository and you can play around with the code. You can also download the code directly, but you may need to do this repeatedly throughout the course as we update the lectures; we strongly recommend learning the basics of git.
