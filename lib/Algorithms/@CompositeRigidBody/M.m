% YOUR TODO LIST:
%   + Using your notes, implement the CRB algorithm
%   + When initializing Ic_i in the first for loop, you should also
%     initialize X_ip and store both values using 
%     b.store(...).  See the RNEA's iD template for guidance on how to
%     store variables.
%   + Make sure to update and store the values of Ic_parent(i) in the 
%     second for loop.  You are updating and then saving the parent's
%     version of Ic.
